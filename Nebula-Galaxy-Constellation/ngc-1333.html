        <h1>NGC-1333</h1>
        <p>also known as the Embryo Nebula, is a captivating reflection nebula located approximately 960 light-years away 
            in the constellation Perseus. This star-forming region is rich in young stellar objects and offers valuable insights 
            into the processes that lead to star and planetary formation.
        </p>
        <h2>Infrared Imaging</h2>
        <p>
            The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has provided stunning infrared images of NGC 1333, focusing on wavelengths 
            of **1.5 μm** and **2.0 μm**. These observations penetrate the dense dust clouds, revealing hidden young stars and 
            their surrounding disks of gas and dust.
        </p>
        <h2>Color Assignments</h2>
        <p>
            In the color mapping of NGC 1333, different wavelengths are represented by distinct colors:<br>
                Red: Indicates warmer dust and gas.<br>
                Orange: Highlights areas where gas glows in infrared due to heating from nearby stars.<br>
                Blue: Represents cooler temperatures or less dense gas.<br>

        </p>
        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <p><strong>Young Stars and Disks:</strong> The infrared emissions reveal young stars otherwise obscured in visible light, essential for understanding star formation.
            <strong>Herbig-Haro Objects:</strong> These bright regions formed by jets from young stars interacting with surrounding gas exhibit 
            vibrant colors like orange and yellow, indicating energetic processes at play.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The color spectrum of NGC 1333, enhanced by JWST's advanced infrared capabilities, provides a fascinating view into 
            the dynamic processes of star formation. This nebula serves as a crucial laboratory for studying how stars and 
            planetary systems evolve.
