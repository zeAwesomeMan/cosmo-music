        <h1>Orion Nebula</h1>
        <p>showcases a stunning array of colors that reflect its complex composition and dynamic processes. 
            Here's a concise overview of its color characteristics and the techniques used to capture them:
        <h2>Key Elements and Their Colors</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Hydrogen:</strong> Emission from ionized hydrogen appears as deep red, primarily due to the hydrogen alpha line (656.3 nm).<br>
            <strong>Oxygen:</strong> Ionized oxygen emits a striking teal or blue-green hue, observable at wavelengths around 495.9 nm and 500.7 nm.<br>
            <strong>Sulfur:</strong> Sulfur emissions contribute a rich deep red, often combined with hydrogen in composite images.<br>
        </p>
        <h2>Imaging Techniques</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Color Mapping:</strong> Astronomers utilize color mapping techniques to assign specific colors to different 
            elements—red for sulfur, green for hydrogen, and blue for oxygen—enhancing the visibility of the nebula's omponents.<br>

            <strong>Filters:</strong> Narrowband filters isolate specific wavelengths, allowing clearer differentiation of emissions from various
            elements. <br>

            <strong>Human Perception:</strong> While the Orion Nebula appears as a gray smudge to the naked eye, optimal conditions<br>
             may reveal subtle shades of blue or green. Specialized telescopic imaging brings out the vibrant colors that convey<br>
             vital information about its composition and ongoing processes.<br>

        </p>
        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <p><strong>Young Stars and Disks:</strong> The infrared emissions reveal young stars otherwise obscured in visible light, essential for understanding star formation.
            <strong>Herbig-Haro Objects:</strong> These bright regions formed by jets from young stars interacting with surrounding gas exhibit 
            vibrant colors like orange and yellow, indicating energetic processes at play.
        </p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The color spectrum of NGC 1333, enhanced by JWST's advanced infrared capabilities, provides a fascinating view into 
            the dynamic processes of star formation. This nebula serves as a crucial laboratory for studying how stars and 
            planetary systems evolve.
